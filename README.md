# COVID-19-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

The notebooks in this repository were authored for the purposes of both teaching myself elementary sentiment analysis techniques and to teach other members of a five person team. 
Our project was to collect Tweets related to COVID-19 and use sentiment analysis to learn about the public's sentiment towards the virus. These sentiment insights were then 
used to quantify the so-called "politicization" of the virus: the way in which the discussion around the virus became increasingly politically charged.
